# Implementation Summary: Logs API Clear Functionality

## Issue Description
The issue requested that the logs API should allow clearing logs programmatically via the API endpoint.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added DELETE Method to /api/logs Endpoint

**Location**: `app.py`, lines 624-733

**Changes**:
- Added `'DELETE'` to the methods list for the `/api/logs` route
- Implemented DELETE handler that:
  - Archives the current log file to `app.log.cleared.{timestamp}`
  - Returns JSON response with status and archive path
  - Handles cases where no log file exists
  - Logs the clear operation via `send_debug()`

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Logs cleared successfully",
  "archive_path": "/app/logs/app.log.cleared.1234567890"
}
```

### 2. Key Features

1. **Archive (Don't Delete)**: Logs are archived with timestamps rather than deleted, allowing recovery if needed
2. **Consistent API**: Uses the same endpoint as log retrieval, following RESTful conventions
3. **Error Handling**: Properly handles edge cases like:
   - No log file exists
   - Multiple rapid clear requests
   - File system errors
4. **Debug Logging**: Creates a `logs_cleared_via_api` debug event for audit trail
5. **JSON Response**: Returns structured JSON consistent with other API endpoints

### 3. Documentation Updates

**README.md**:
- Updated section 7 to document both GET and DELETE methods
- Added DELETE method usage examples
- Included response format examples
- Added dashboard usage notes

**examples_api_logs.sh**:
- Added example 6 showing DELETE usage with curl
- Updated Python integration example with DELETE
- Updated PowerShell integration example with DELETE
- Added "Logs are archived (not deleted)" to key benefits

### 4. Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:

**Basic Functionality**:
- ✓ GET /api/logs (no parameters) - returns usage info including DELETE
- ✓ GET /api/logs?all - retrieves all logs
- ✓ GET /api/logs?recent=N - retrieves recent N logs
- ✓ DELETE /api/logs - clears and archives logs

**Edge Cases**:
- ✓ DELETE when no log file exists - returns success message
- ✓ Multiple rapid DELETE calls - all handled gracefully
- ✓ GET after DELETE - continues to work correctly

**Integration Tests**:
- ✓ Complete workflow test passed (8/8 tests)
- ✓ Response format validation passed
- ✓ Archived files created with correct timestamps

**Security**:
- ✓ CodeQL scan: 0 vulnerabilities
- ✓ No sensitive data exposure in responses
- ✓ Proper error handling without stack trace leaks

## Usage Examples

### cURL
```bash
# Clear logs
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/logs

# Response:
# {
#   "status": "success",
#   "message": "Logs cleared successfully",
#   "archive_path": "/app/logs/app.log.cleared.1234567890"
# }
```

### Python
```python
import requests

response = requests.delete('http://localhost:5000/api/logs')
if response.json()['status'] == 'success':
    print("Logs cleared successfully")
    print(f"Archive: {response.json().get('archive_path')}")
```

### PowerShell
```powershell
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/logs" -Method Delete
if ($response.status -eq "success") {
    Write-Host "Logs cleared successfully"
    Write-Host "Archive: $($response.archive_path)"
}
```

## Benefits

1. **API Consistency**: Uses RESTful DELETE method on the same endpoint
2. **Audit Trail**: Logs are archived, not deleted
3. **Programmatic Access**: Can be integrated into automation scripts
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Can be called from web dashboards
5. **Error Recovery**: Archived logs can be retrieved if needed

## Files Modified

1. **app.py**
   - Updated `/api/logs` route to accept DELETE method
   - Added archive logic
   - Updated usage info message

2. **README.md**
   - Updated section 7 with DELETE documentation
   - Added response format examples
   - Added usage notes

3. **examples_api_logs.sh**
   - Added DELETE example
   - Updated integration examples
   - Updated benefits list

## Backward Compatibility

- ✓ All existing GET functionality preserved
- ✓ No breaking changes to API responses
- ✓ Existing `/resolve_errors` endpoint still works
- ✓ Compatible with existing dashboards and scripts

## Deployment Notes

- No configuration changes required
- No database migrations needed
- No restart required (hot-reload supported)
- Works with existing Docker deployments

## Conclusion

The implementation fully addresses the issue requirements:
- ✓ Logs API now allows clearing logs
- ✓ Uses standard RESTful DELETE method
- ✓ Logs are safely archived (not deleted)
- ✓ Comprehensive documentation provided
- ✓ All tests passing
- ✓ Zero security vulnerabilities
