# Call Recording Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Call Recording feature allows administrators and authorized users to view and manage call recordings from Twilio through the branch dashboard interface. Each branch has its own recordings filtered by the branch's Twilio phone numbers.

## Features

### 1. Call Recordings Section
- **Location**: Branch Dashboard (collapsible section)
- **Access**: Users with `can_view` permission for the branch
- **Icon**: ðŸ“ž Call Recordings

### 2. Recording Display
Each recording shows:
- **From/To Numbers**: Formatted phone numbers
- **Date/Time**: When the recording was created
- **Duration**: Length of the recording in seconds
- **Status**: Recording status (completed, processing, etc.)
- **Audio Player**: Built-in HTML5 audio player for playback
- **Download Button**: Download the recording as MP3
- **Recording SID**: Twilio recording identifier

### 3. Pagination
- Navigate through recordings with Previous/Next buttons
- Configurable page size (5-50 recordings per page)
- Page number indicator

### 4. Settings
Two new settings in the Branch Settings page under "Basic Settings - Feature Toggles":

#### enable_call_recording
- **Type**: Checkbox
- **Default**: true
- **Purpose**: Show/hide the call recordings section in the branch dashboard
- **Label**: "Enable Call Recordings Display"

#### call_recording_page_size
- **Type**: Number
- **Default**: 20
- **Range**: 5-50 (increments of 5)
- **Purpose**: Control how many recordings are displayed per page
- **Label**: "Call Recordings Per Page"

## API Endpoint

### GET /api/branch/<branch>/recordings

Fetches call recordings for a specific branch from Twilio.

**Authentication**: Required (login_required decorator)

**Permissions**: User must have `can_view` permission for the branch

**Query Parameters**:
- `page` (optional, default: 0): Page number for pagination
- `page_size` (optional, default: 20): Number of recordings per page

**Response Format**:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "recordings": [
        {
            "sid": "RExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "call_sid": "CAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "duration": "45",
            "date_created": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
            "from": "+15201234567",
            "to": "+15551234567",
            "status": "completed",
            "uri": "/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACxxxx/Recordings/RExxxx.json",
            "media_url": "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACxxxx/Recordings/RExxxx.mp3"
        }
    ],
    "page": 0,
    "page_size": 20,
    "count": 15
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- `400`: Twilio credentials not configured
- `403`: Permission denied
- `404`: Invalid branch
- `500`: Failed to fetch recordings from Twilio

**Filtering Logic**:
Recordings are automatically filtered to show only calls where:
- The `from` number matches any of the branch's Twilio phone numbers, OR
- The `to` number matches any of the branch's Twilio phone numbers

Branch phone numbers include:
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
- `TWILIO_AUTOMATED_NUMBER`
- `TWILIO_TRANSFER_NUMBER`

## Implementation Details

### Frontend JavaScript (admin-dashboard/static/js/dashboard.js)
- `loadCallRecordings(branchKey, page)`: Fetches recordings via API
- `displayRecordings(recordings, container)`: Renders recording items
- `updatePaginationControls(branchKey, currentPage, count, container)`: Updates pagination UI
- `loadCallRecordingsOnOpen(branchKey)`: Lazy-loads recordings when section is opened

### Templates

#### branch_dashboard.html
- Added collapsible section for call recordings
- Includes loading spinner with CSS animation
- Error message display area
- Recordings container with pagination controls

#### branch_settings.html
- Added two new settings fields
